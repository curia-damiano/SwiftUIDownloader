# By default, SwiftLint uses a set of sensible default rules you can adjust:
# Rule Directory Reference: https://realm.github.io/SwiftLint/rule-directory.html
disabled_rules: # rule identifiers turned on by default to exclude from running
  - identifier_name						# to allow "vm"
  - line_length							# to allow lines wiht comments
  - redundant_optional_initialization	# to clarify code
  - vertical_parameter_alignment		# because of bug https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/1573
